Hello, you have discovered my permanent notes. This is a space for me to make notes whilst
[working with the garage door open](notes/working-with-the-garage-door-open.md).

My interests include Git, Python, MLOps, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.

The website design is heavily inspired by [ Andy Matuschakâ€™s working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWfAoTKF7wKKivTbh7kQLPK).
